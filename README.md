## Week 1:
- In the very first week, I was introduced to a strange but interesting subject called DISMATH.
- Answering exercises in the book will help masterize the lessons.
- I discovered what "Discrete Mathematics" is all about.
- I learned that the subject focuses on mathematical truths instead of scientific or probable truths.
- I also learned that a proposition is a declarative statement which must be true or false.
- Some examples are: DLSU is along Taft Avenue; 2 + 1 = 3.
- Logical connectives were discussed as foundations of this subject.
- Statements, especially with only few variables, can be proven by using Truth table.
- At first, I was anxious because of the unfamiliar symbols used in math.

| Logical Symbol  |  Logical Operator | Shorthand | Formula | Logical Expression |
| :-----: |:-------:|:-----:| :-------: | :-------: |
| ¬ |Negation | not | val(¬p) = 1 - val(p) | ¬p |
| ∧ | Conjunction | and | val(p ∧ q) = min(val(p), val(q)) | p ∧ q |
| v | Disjunction | or | val(p v q) = max(val(p), val(q)) | p v q |
| ⊕ | Exclusive disjunction | xor | if val(p)  not equal val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0|  p ⊕ q  ≡ (¬p ∧ q) v (p ∧ ¬q) |
| → | Conditional | if, then | if val(p)  ≤ val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0  | p → q ≡  ¬p v q |
| ↔ | Biconditional | iff | if val(p) equals val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0 |  p ↔ q ≡ (p → q) ∧ (q → p) |

- The last thing I learned before the end of the first week was propositional logic.
- Inverse of p → q: ¬p → ¬q
- Converse of p → q: q → p
- Contrapositive of p → q: ¬q → ¬p

## Week 2:
- In the second week, I was introduced to a set of new laws that would be used throughout this course.
- I learned another method of evaluating logical statements aside from Truth table, which is logical equivalences.
- Logical Equivalences:

|                           Equivalence                          |         Name        |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------:|
|                      p ∧ T ≡ p  //     p v F ≡ p               |    Identity laws    |
|                       p v T ≡ T  //    p ∧ F ≡ F               |   Domination laws   |
|                       p v p ≡ p //     p ∧ p ≡ p               |   Idempotent laws   |
|                            ¬(¬p) ≡ p                           | Double negation law |
|                   p v q ≡ q v p // p ∧ q ≡ q ∧ p               |   Commutative laws  |
|       (p v q) v r ≡ p v (q v r) // (p ∧ q) ∧ r ≡ p ∧ (q ∧ r)   |   Associative laws  |
| p v (q ∧ r) ≡ (p v q) ∧ (p v r) //  p ∧(q v r) ≡ (p ∧ q) v (p ∧ r) |  Distributive laws  |
|              ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p v ¬q // ¬(p v q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q          |   De Morgan's laws  |
|                 p v (p ∧ q) ≡ p // p ∧ (p v q) ≡ p             |   Absorption laws   |
|                     p v ¬p ≡ T // p ∧ ¬p ≡ F                   |    Negation laws    |

- I had my first homework about Superman logic, and it was challenging.
- Superman does not exist logically!
- After discussing logical equivalences, the lesson shifted to quantifiers.
- Two types are:
- Universal (∀x) - should be true to all values; predicate is true for every element under consideration.
- Existensial (∃x) - true to atleast one value; one or more element under consideration for which the predicate is true.
- This week ended with rules of inference.
- Argument - sequence of statements that end with a conclusion. Ex. (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ... ∧ pn) → q
- Valid - conclusion of the argument must follow from the true of the preceding statements of the argument. Ex. (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ... ∧ pn) → q is TAUTOLOGY
- Fallacy - an invalid argument.

## Week 3:
